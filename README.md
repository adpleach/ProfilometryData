"# ProfilometryData" 

App hosted at https://share.streamlit.io/adpleach/profilometrydata/main/StreamlitApp.py

Designed to manipulate data collected on KLA Tencor P-7 and exported as .txt file with APEX software.

App will level surface profile data collected using stylus profilometer, calculate step height and surface roughness (RMS, Ra, TIR), and identify steps that are too narrow to give meaningful stepheight data.

Demo files are available to test the app in the repository (300mJ1, 3000rpm_3, silicon15cyclescenter, Valves no reflow_2)
